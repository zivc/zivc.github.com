<p>If you really need to get in contact with me, I'd prefer you tweet me at <a href="http://twitter.com/zivcjs">@zivcjs</a> or get at me on Github <a href="http://github.com/zivc">@zivc</a>.</p>

<p>If you're a recruiter, my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=60335448">linkedin</a> is fully up to date, and I probably am the perfect fit for your role, however I am most definitely not interested. Should it actually be a real, legit 'fantastic' position, you'll usually get a response if you tell me the salary straight up.</p>

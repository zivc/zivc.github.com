### Current Position

__FIS Global / SunGard Financial Systems__ : *UX/Javascript Developer* __July 2014 - Present__

Joined SunGard APT in July 2014 as a sole UX/Javascript developer to improve, and really evangelise the front-end work flow on our risk management offering, APT Enterprise which is marketed towards mainly institutional hedgefunds, other large UK banks and pension funds.

Working with a MEAN stack (M for MySQL) in an Agile environment, my main purpose is influencing front-end architecture decisions to the rest of the team (mainly Java developers) and sparking new ideas in an industry that conventionally uses Java and GWT.

Portion of my time is spent building internal tools to improve the work flow of our Managed Services and Client Services teams across our main, multi-tenant application.

As of 2015 I have been tasked with re-building the entire UI of one of our risk management offerings, APT Enterprise. We're using SailsJS (Real-Time NodeJs MVC framework) for the REST API and AngularJS for the client side MVC framework. For large data grids we also leverage React to get much faster render times when Angulars $digest cycle gets too slow. We use KendoUI throughout this application plus a library of hand-crafted components. Our Sails application reads from a read-only database instance and then proxies requests through to a traditional Java app server via AMQP.

SunGard was acquired in December 2015 by FIS Global.

### Full Employment History

__TOAD__ : *Contract Lead Front-End Developer* __June 2014 - March 2015__

Worked on various projects at TOAD. Primarily building an MVP of a gambling app that is similar to a football accumulator, where friends predict scores based on Premier League football and optionally include a wager. The winner is the one with the closest predictions. The site utlised Enetpulse - the same live scoring service that powered the IMG DGE I built at Livestream (below). I also worked on various other projects such as a full site build for a Global M, a large gloabl recruitment company, and maintenance for various other small projects such as for Propia.



__Livestream__ : *Dev lead & Front-End Developer* __July 2013 - June 2014__

Built a full, end-to-end, b2b2c, PaaS product from scratch which allowed third party betting/gaming websites to syndicate live sports content to their consumers, utilising the scalability of Google App Engine. This product was a joint effort between IMG Media and Livestream, known as the IMG DGE (Digital Gaming Exchange). Working as a sole FED with 4 Java developers and attended company hackathons in Ukraine. Used AngularJS and Bootstrap heavily throughout the project. We built an entire analytics platform in a week using Google BigQuery. I also built a real time map (mapbox/leafletjs) that showed connections to the platform in real time (pubnub), drawing with d3. Other duties include liaising with a globally distributed team, delegating work, communicating directly with our client, general project and product management, managing timings and scheduling releases.

Worked on redevelopment of Tesco Real Food. Complete overhaul of Tesco magazine. Developed new gallery features for BA High Life and BA Business High Life. Inherited Newsgator.com and worked with third party companies on the deployment. Worked on a project for Intelligent Energy, a responsive website that had to cater for devices of all different resolutions from 240px wide up to and beyond 1600px. I was largely a sole FED, but liaised with the Managing Director directly to find, interview, and shortlist new developers. Shortly after joining Reactive I were head hunted to join Livestream.

I'm just a face from south London. Living in East London. Admirably self-taught. Definitely imperfectly self-taught without a doubt.

At 16 I started teaching myself Front-End development. Quit college. Didn't even bother thinking about University. Got my first break at the UKs biggest Email Marketing platform. Learnt loads. Mainly about age discrimination. Left there. Started cutting my teeth at various digital marketing/advertising agencies. Big and small. Won an award for a project once. IPM Gold for Health and Beauty. Was for a brand of deoderant. Mens.

I then contracted for a bit. Mostly on 'shit has hit the fan' projects. Kinda pursued an interest in the music industry parallel to that. Lots of live streaming involved. Loads of booze too. Tried an ad agency again as a permie. Lead developer. Had an odd pay cycle. Twice monthly lolz. Damn Australians. Got headhunted for a fairly big US based streaming startup. Involved live sports content for gambling purposes. Left there and ended up in Fintech.

Working for a pretty large financial services company in London now. Only industry I've not worked in. Thought, fuck it. Been there a year now. Got a sick view. 40th floor. Can see as far as Canvey Island. Anyway. Leading UI development in my business unit. Mainly working on risk management related things. Evangelising Javascript in a traditionally Java environment. Lots of old guys not doing anything new. Loads of clever people though. Just slowed down by corporate bureaucracy. Ex-Molecular Biologists and University maths lecturers etc. Building a lot of proof of concepts to show its not all about Spring MVC. It is fun. I like it. Exceeding a great deal of expectations. Been tasked with "shaking things up".

No intention to leave. Unless of course, the *Espressochoc* item is removed from our vending machines.

In my spare time I like running. Training for the 2015 Virgin Money London Marathon. Should be alright. Aiming for less than 4 hours 18 mins. I also run with a running club. Started lifting weights at the gym. Getting that beach body. Don't wanna be that guy who ruins all the photos. I love beer. Achilles' heel. It is currently my main carb intake. However sometimes the salad I just ordered has croutons. Croutons translates roughly to 'last bread' in French. Bun the French. Fucking love pistachios and malt loaf. Not a fan of coleslaw. Desperately want to speak fluent Swedish. Hur mår du, min älskling?

Wagwan, blud?

I'm a bloke from south London. Self-taught. Quit college, taught myself Front-End development from the age of 16. Cut my teeth in various digital marketing companies. Won an award for it once. Freelanced for a bit. Finding my feet in Fintech. Working for a pretty large financial services company in London. Leading UI development in my business unit. Mainly working on risk management related things, and building a lot of internal tooling for our Managed Services brethren. It is fun. I like it. No intention to leave. Unless of course, the *Espressochoc* product is removed from our vending machines.

In my spare time I like running. Training for the 2015 Virgin Money London Marathon. Should be alright. I also run with a running club. Started lifting weights at the gym. Getting that beach body. Don't wanna be that guy who ruins all the photos. I love beer. It is my only carb intake. However sometimes the salad I just ordered has croutons. Croutons translates roughly to 'last bread' in French. Fucking love pistachios and malt loaf. Not a fan of coleslaw. Desperately want to speak fluent Swedish. Hur mår du, min älskling?
